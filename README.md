# AngularA1

## JSON - Server

You have to start a json-server before running the application to access data

To install json-server run the below command
 `npm install -g json-server`

 After that you need to start a json server on port 3000 with following command
`json-server --port 3000 src/api/employees/employees.json` 

once this is done run `npm start`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
